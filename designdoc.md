What is the software application or feature?

    Wrapper around openCV to simplify camera callibration pipeline and perform simple structure from motion.

Whoâ€™s it intended for? 

    Intended for me as a selfstudy project in structure from motion

What problem does the software solve? 

    Solves the problem of organizing my scipts into a small simple library i can re-use while working with images and videos

How is it going to work? 

    You read a set of images from a folder or a video
    You perform a calibration using openCV
    You can write and read callibration files

    You can get a camera object that can undirstort images / and project data between world, camera and image coordinate systems

What are the main concepts that are involved and how are they related?

2. User interface
CLI and importable library

if person X knew python he could be able to follow an example an perform his own callibration or structure from motion using a video or a image folder through CLI
